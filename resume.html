            <h3>NCAA Track and Field Database</h3>
            <p>As my first major project and a perfect intersection of my personal and professional interests, I was thrilled to combine my passion for sports and data analysis. After recognizing the lack of readily available methods for exploratory analysis, I embarked on creating a comprehensive data portfolio. This project showcases my proficiency in SQL for database management and querying, as well as my ability to generate insightful visualizations using Python. To ensure a streamlined and efficient development process, I leverage tools such as VS Code and GitHub for version control. Currently, the database is hosted on my local server for preparation, but once the setup and initial development are complete, my plan is to host the database on AWS and integrate it into my personal website. This will enable easy access and collaboration with fellow track and field enthusiasts.</p>
